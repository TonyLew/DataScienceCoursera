This website will calculate the total number of months it will take to pay off your mortgage with the amount of rent you are currently paying.

Although this is an overly simple website, it can be built upon to create much more interesting graphs and statistics.

The concept with the site is simply.  Enter the information for the house you would consider purchasing and the current rent you are paying.

```{r echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


```
